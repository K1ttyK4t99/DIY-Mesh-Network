Documentation for my own DIY mesh network using OpenWRT and DDWRT

I came across an issue in my own home network recently, and wanted to come up with a solution to my problem. My printer, which is located upstairs, has really spotty connection to my main router (displays a single bar on the signal strength) so, I'm coming up with a solution to my problem. My wife was out thrift shopping and found a Linksys WRT54G V8 for really cheap, so I thought, why not? I can make a solution with this.

After a lot of research, I found that OpenWRT doesn't work on this model of router, so I decided to go with DD-WRT instead for that router. So, I did a factory reset on the router and was able to access the admin interface.
